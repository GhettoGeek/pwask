The most advanced server less starter kit for a single page application. It's bootstrapped with:

* The blazing fast and zero configuration [Parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html)
* [Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)

Based on [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) methodology for organizing components and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/) for stylizing them.
